## 1. Ground Rules (Please Read Carefully)
Quiz 3 is a mixture of in-class and take-home activities. 
 
### In-Class Exercises
The first part of the quiz will be completed **during class.** It must be turned in by the end of class. You may use your notes, pen and paper, and any "cheat sheats" that you want to make. You may not use a computer. 

### Take Home Exercises
For the take-home portion of the quiz, you may begin working on it as soon as it is posted (Friday, 4/21 at 8AM). It is due on **Monday (4/24) at 11:59PM.** No quizzes will be accepted after this time.  For the take home portion of the quiz:

* You **MAY** use the course website, as well as any notes, lecture files, or internet reference materials to complete the quiz.
* You **MAY NOT** discuss the quiz with anyone or collaborate in any way with anyone. This is an individual assessment.
