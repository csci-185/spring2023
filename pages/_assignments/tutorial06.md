For today's tutorial, you will get started on [HW4](hw05). Your job is to get as far as you can on the homepage.

## What to Submit
To submit Tutorial 6, just link the start page of the FroYo website. See Sarah's homepage to see an example of what your homepage should look like:
* <a href="https://vanwars.github.io/csci185-coursework/" target="_blank">https://vanwars.github.io/csci185-coursework/</a>

When you're done, paste the following links into the Moodle under the Tutorial 6 submission section:

1. A link to your **homepage** on GitHub pages, which should link to the start of your FroYo website.
2. A link to your GitHub **code repository** (where your code files are stored).
