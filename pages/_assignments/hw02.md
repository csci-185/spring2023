## Overview
For your second homework, you will practice some basic HTML tasks that are fundamental to the development of high-quality websites:

1. [Linking](#task01)
2. [Using Semantic Containers](#task02)
2. [Publishing to GitHub](#task03)

Please download the starter files (below) and complete the tasks described below. Read the instructions that are outlined under each task **very carefully.** You must complete each exercise exactly as the instructions indicate to receive full credit. Otherwise, you will receive partial credit for the parts you correctly completed.

### [10pts] Task 1: Linking to Pages & Media Using Relative & Absolute Paths

For Task #1, You will be creating the website shown in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tUF1rB-0q2iHU6vUaITRbd1Uy6ZAoO16/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this video</a> and pictured in the screenshots below.

<img class="small" src="/spring2023/assets/images/quizzes/quiz01/home.png" /> <img class="small" src="/spring2023/assets/images/quizzes/quiz01/mammals.png" /> <img class="small" src="/spring2023/assets/images/quizzes/quiz01/reptiles.png" /> <img class="small" src="/spring2023/assets/images/quizzes/quiz01/sea-creatures.png" />


To do this, open the `task01` folder. You should see a file structure that looks like this:

```shell
task01
├── images
│   ├── mammals
│   │   ├── fox.jpeg
│   │   ├── lion.jpg
│   │   ├── monkey.jpg
│   │   ├── squirrel.jpg
│   │   ├── tiger.png
│   │   └── zebra.jpeg
│   ├── reptiles
│   │   ├── chameleon.jpeg
│   │   └── turtle.jpeg
│   └── sea-creatures
│       ├── fish
│       │   └── fish.png
│       └── other
│           └── jellyfish.jpeg
├── index.html
├── pages
│   ├── mammals.html
│   ├── reptiles.html
│   └── sea-creatures.html
└── styles.css
```

Then, complete the 4 subtasks:


{:.checkbox-list}
* **[2pts]** Modify `index.html`, `mammals.html`, `reptiles.html`, and `sea-creatures.html` so that each page links to the `styles.css` stylesheet. You will know that you did it correctly if the web page looks styled when you preview it.
* **[3pts]** Modify the hyperlinks inside of the `<nav>` sections of `index.html`, `mammals.html`, `reptiles.html`, and `sea-creatures.html` so that every HTML page links to every other HTML page **using relative paths**. 
    * In case it isn't clear, the hyperlink associated with the "Home" link text should link to `index.html` (see the video above for a demo).
* **[3pts]** Add images to `mammals.html`, `reptiles.html`, and `sea-creatures.html` inside of the `<section class="photo-container"></section>` tag. Ensure that you are using **relative paths** to the corresponding image in the `images` folder.
    * Mammals should display 6 images (fox, lion, monkey, squirrel, tiger, and zebra).
    * Reptiles should display 2 images (chameleon and turtle).
    * Sea Creatures should display 2 images (fish and jellyfish).
* **[2pts]** Inside of `mammals.html`, `reptiles.html`, and `sea-creatures.html`, add a hyperlink to a Wikipedia page where you can learn more about each animal category. You will do this above the `<section class="photo-container"></section>` tag but still inside of the `<main></main>` tag.
    * `mammals.html` should have a link to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal.
    * `reptiles.html` should have a link to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptile.
    * `sea-creatures.html` should have a link to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_life.

### [6pts] Task 2: Using Semantic Containers
For your second task, you are going to practice working with ***semantic*** tags. Recall that semantic tags help screen readers and search engines (i.e., robots) understand the structure of your webpage. Using these tags effectively has huge implications for the usability of your website and how effectively search engines and web scrapers are able to index and understand what your page is about.

To practice using semantic tags, you are going to do two things:
1. Read <a href="https://htmlandcssguidebook.com/html/html5-semantic/" target="_blank">this article on semantic tags</a>
2. Complete <a href="https://htmlandcssguidebook.com/quizzes/html-semantic.html" target="_blank">this quiz</a> on semantic HTML. 

#### Please Read Carefully
You will submit your `task02` answers as follows:
1. Before you click the "Check Your Work" button on Step 10 (the last step of the quiz), you will copy all of the HTML code (with all the edits that you made) and paste your code inside of the body tag in the `task02/history.html` file.
2. **Important:** Make sure that you copy all of your code before you click the "Check Your Work" button. After you successfully complete the exercise, the quiz won't let you go back and preview your work.
