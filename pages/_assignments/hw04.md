## Overview
This homework can be completed individually or in pairs. Working in pairs does not mean "splitting up the work" so that each person does half of the tasks. Rather, both parties should complete the tasks and help one another as questions arise.

### References
CSS is best understood through practice, and by consulting online resources as needed. Here are a curated list of resources that should help you complete your tasks:

### 1. Flexbox Froggy
TODO: Instructions


### 2. Center-align elements within a container

Open `02-flex` and create the layout shown below by editing the CSS file. You should not need to edit the HTML.

<img src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw04/exercise04.gif" />

Please ensure that the following criteria are met:

{:.compact}
* The height of each `section` should be the same as the height of the browser window.
* The content inside of each `section` tag should be centered horizontally and vertically.
* Each `section` should have a different background color.
* The content in each `section` should be stacked vertically

### 3. Create a Navigation Bar
Open `03-navbar`, and try to make the following layout using flex. The navigation bar should also be anchored to the top so when you scroll, the nav bar stays fixed.

<img class="frame large" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw04/exercise05.png" />

Hints:

{:.compact}
* Both the `nav` and `ul` elements will need to be put into flex mode.
* Use the Chrome inspector to adjust the alignment properties.
* To turn the bullets off, set the `list-style-type` property to `none`.
* To create a fixed menu, see <a href="https://codepen.io/vanwars/pen/LYBdyzJ?editors=0100" target="_blank">this code sample</a>: 


### 4. CSS Grid Garden
TODO: Instructions

### 5. Create this layout

Open `05-grid`, and try to make the following layout using CSS Grid. You should not need to modify the HTML file. Note that the gridlines are just for demonstration, but they wonâ€™t actually be visible.

<img class="small" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw04/exercise06b.png" />

**Note:** You do NOT have to center the text inside of each section unless you want to.

### 6. Create the Taco Temple layout

Open `06-tacotemple`, and try to make the following layout using CSS Grid. You should only have to edit the CSS file. 

<img class="large" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw04/tacotemple01.png" />

**A few hints:**
The `main` container is a grid with two columns -- no rows specified). See grid lines: 

<img class="large" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw04/tacotemple02.png" />

The `section` container is also a grid with two columns. See grid lines: 

<img class="small" src="/spring2023/assets/images/homework/hw04/tacotemple03.png" />

### 7. Create the following mobile / responsive layout
TODO: Instructions. Something that works w/media queries!

## What to turn in
Something about linking (make a demo)...
